ðŸ”¹ DNS Event Names				ðŸ”¸ DHCP Event Names	
					
1. client: query				1. dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER	
Logs DNS queries received from clients.				Client broadcasted a discovery packet for IP address.	
					
2. client: query (cache)				2. dhcpd: DHCPOFFER	
Logs DNS queries answered from cache.				Server offered an IP lease to a client.	
					
3. resolver: query response				3. dhcpd: DHCPREQUEST	
Logs responses received from upstream DNS servers.				Client requested the offered IP lease.	
					
4. security: denied recursion				4. dhcpd: DHCPACK	
Indicates recursion was denied due to policy or security settings.				Server acknowledged and finalized IP lease.	
					
5. update: dynamic update				5. dhcpd: DHCPDECLINE	
Logs attempts to dynamically update DNS records.				Client declined the IP lease (usually due to conflict).	
					
6. lame_servers: lame server				6. dhcpd: DHCPRELEASE	
Indicates a bad delegation or misconfigured DNS server.				Client released the IP lease back to the server.	
					
7. notify: zone transfer				7. dhcpd: DHCPINFORM	
Logs DNS NOTIFY messages sent to secondary servers.				Client requested additional configuration (without needing an IP).	
					
8. dnssec: validation				8. omshell: remote command	
Logs DNSSEC signing or validation operations.				Logs remote DHCP management operations.	
					
9. query_rewrite: modified query				9. dhcrelay: relayed message	
Indicates a query was rewritten per policy rules.				Logs requests or replies relayed through DHCP relay agent.	
					
10. rpz: policy triggered				10. dhclient: lease activity	
Indicates that a DNS query matched an RPZ rule.				Logs lease requests or renewals from client side.	
					
11. transfer-in					
Logs zone transfers received from other servers.					
					
12. transfer-out					
Logs zone transfers sent to other servers.					
					
13. config: file parsed					
Indicates a DNS config file was parsed or reloaded.					
					
14. database: internal change					
Logs database changes within the DNS service.					
					
15. network: communication issue

16. general: system info					
Captures general operational messages.					
					
17. update-security: policy result					
Indicates success or failure of security checks during dynamic updates.					
					
18. rate-limit: throttled response					
Logs when rate limiting (RRL) was applied.
