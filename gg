ArcSight Parser Configuration
InfoBlox logs are parsed in ArcSight using the following configuration:
•	Device Product: InfoBlox
•	Device Vendor: InfoBlox Inc.
•	Category Technique: Syslog


5. Detection Use Cases
Use Case 1: Unauthorized Administrative Access
Description: Detects potential unauthorized access to InfoBlox administration interfaces. Critical for protecting cardholder data environments (CDE) DNS infrastructure.
ArcSight Rule:
Name: BANK_InfoBlox_Unauthorized_Admin_Access
Priority: High
Condition:
  deviceVendor = "InfoBlox Inc." AND
  categoryBehavior = "Authentication" AND
  (message CONTAINS "login failed" OR
   (message CONTAINS "logged in" AND sourceAddress NOT IN LIST AdminSourceIPs))
Aggregation: 3 events in 5 minutes
Evidence to Collect:
Mar 13 14:22:33 infoblox.local httpd[1234]: admin "admin" failed login from 10.0.0.100
Mar 13 14:22:38 infoblox.local httpd[1234]: admin "admin" failed login from 10.0.0.100
Mar 13 14:22:43 infoblox.local httpd[1234]: admin "admin" logged in from 10.0.0.100
Mar 13 14:22:55 infoblox.local httpd[1234]: admin "admin" modified zone "bankingdomain.eg"
Tier 1 SOC Analyst Response:
1.	Verify if the source IP is associated with authorized administrators
2.	Check if access occurred during bank's change management windows
3.	Contact the admin to confirm if access was legitimate
4.	Document findings in ticket
5.	Check for correlation with Egyptian banking threat intelligence
Escalation: Escalate to Tier 2 SOC if:
•	No change management ticket exists
•	Access from external IP address
•	More than 5 failed login attempts
•	IP address associated with Egyptian threat actors


Use Case 2: Critical DNS Configuration Changes
Description: Monitors for potentially malicious changes to DNS configurations that could impact banking services or redirect customers to fraudulent sites.
ArcSight Rule:
Name: BANK_InfoBlox_Critical_DNS_Change
Priority: High

  deviceVendor = "InfoBlox Inc." AND
  categoryBehavior = "Modify" AND
  categoryObject = "Configuration" AND
  message CONTAINS ANY ("zone", "dns", "record", "deleted", "modified", "created") AND
  (message CONTAINS ANY ("banking", "payment", "secure", "login", "account", ".eg") OR
   message CONTAINS ANY (list:EgyptianBankingDomains))
Evidence to Collect:
Mar 13 14:30:15 infoblox.local named[1234]: zone ourbank.eg/IN: creating new master file /var/named/master/db.ourbank.eg
Mar 13 14:30:22 infoblox.local named[1234]: zone ourbank.eg/IN: loaded serial 2025031302
Mar 13 14:30:25 infoblox.local httpd[1234]: admin "admin" modified record "login.ourbank.eg" A value changed from "192.168.10.50" to "192.168.10.51"
Mar 13 14:31:05 infoblox.local httpd[1234]: admin "admin" created record "secure-verify.ourbank.eg" A value "10.0.0.100"
Tier 1 SOC Analyst Response:
1.	Cross-reference with change management tickets
2.	Identify which admin made the change
3.	Document exact changes made to Egyptian banking-related DNS records
4.	Validate if change impacts online banking or payment systems
5.	Check if new DNS entries match known phishing patterns
Escalation: Escalate to Tier 2 SOC if:
•	Change affects Egyptian online banking domains
•	Change made outside maintenance window
•	Change has no corresponding change ticket
•	New IPs are outside our expected network ranges


Use Case 3: DNS Data Exfiltration Detection
Description: Identifies potential data exfiltration via DNS tunneling, critical for protecting customer and financial data.

9.	Related DNS activity:
10.	ArcSight query:
11.	deviceVendor = "InfoBlox Inc." AND categoryObject = "DNS" 
12.	AND message CONTAINS "<modified_domain>"
13.	startTime = now()-48h endTime = now()
